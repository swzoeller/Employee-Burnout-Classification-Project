### Business Case   
Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, Large Co. employees have been working from home since April. The company has noticed a decrease in productivity, and suspects it may be due to employee burnout. Large Co. would like to create a model that can predict employee burnout based on various factors, in order to identify and provide support to the employees most affected by the current situation.
